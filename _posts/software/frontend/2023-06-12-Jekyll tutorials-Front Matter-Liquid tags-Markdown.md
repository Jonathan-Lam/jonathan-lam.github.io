There's a lot to learn with Jekyll, Front Matter, and other Jekyll tools but luckily all of them are pretty intuitive if you have experience with HTML beforehand. There's additional Bootstrap to learn to structure Project links, my About page, and perhaps other functionality dealing with images and collapsable tabs, but so far I've learned enough to start actually thinking about formatting actual content (as well as thinking about streamlining tools like Jekyll Compose, more on that later).
