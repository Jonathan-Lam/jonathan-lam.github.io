Blogs are sort of a weird thing for me. There a great medium to get your ideas down, showcase a part of a project, or record progress, and I love to read other people's blogs to understand how they implemented a feature or played around with a new piece of tech, but for some reason I never wanted to make one for myself for the same benefits. I think it's because I never thought it was worth putting my own thoughts into words and I didn't need to prove anything to faceless people on the Internet.

But nowadays I'm finding the benefit of keeping a record of your thoughts somewhere public. Not only does it keep you accountable for your progress but it can be pretty helpful to some random person scraping through Google looking for a solution. It can help showcase what you've been doing to potential employers or just show your project to someone that might be interested. And if it helps my own progress or interests at least one person, then I think it should be worth it.

I'm interested in things like coding, software, technology, game design, and video games, so I'll probably write some posts about those things. I'll post about my current WIP projects or whatever fun things I find on the Internet too. Like for now, I'm relearning Jekyll, Markdown, and front end tools to get this website up and running, so I'm sure I'll be making posts about those stuff. Should be fun.

So I'm starting a blog. Thanks for reading.
