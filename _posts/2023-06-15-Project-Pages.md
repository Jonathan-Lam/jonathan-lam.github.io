I'd like to make a Projects page that lists images and links to each project I'm working on. Temporarily it looks like this:

![img-description](/assets/post_images/projects_page_ex.png)
_Temporary images for now of course, I'm not a farmer_

Each page will have the project image, a summary, list of excerpts and links to related posts for the project, and a list of features/lessons learned/showcase.
