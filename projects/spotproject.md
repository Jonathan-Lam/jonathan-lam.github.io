[Parking Management example image]

This was a project I worked on in 2018 to build a full parking management system with 3 others. We were tasked to build a sensing unit for a parking spot, a backend system for storing and monitoring parking spot statuses, an admin website, and a mobile app for users to visualize open parking spots. I was primarily in charge of backend development, working on the web app, database, and website.
