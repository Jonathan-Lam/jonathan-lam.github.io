title: SPOT Parking Management
layout: page
---
This was a project I worked on in 2018 to build a full parking management system with 3 others. We were tasked to build a sensing unit for a parking spot, a backend system for storing and monitoring parking spot statuses, an admin website, and a mobile app for users to visualize open parking spots. I was primarily in charge of backend development, working on the web app, database, and website.
Below are posts that go in depth on the different components of the project:
